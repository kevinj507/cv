@article{Muldoon2016,
abstract={Quantitative descriptions of network structure in big data can provide fundamental insights into the function of interconnected complex systems. Small-world structure, commonly diagnosed by high local clustering yet short average path length between any two nodes, directly enables information flow in coupled systems, a key function that can differ across conditions or between groups. However, current techniques to quantify small-world structure are dependent on nuisance variables such as density and agnostic to critical variables such as the strengths of connections between nodes, thereby hampering accurate and comparable assessments of small-world structure in different networks. Here, we address both limitations with a novel metric called the Small-World Propensity (SWP). In its binary instantiation, the SWP provides an unbiased assessment of small-world structure in networks of varying densities. We extend this concept to the case of weighted networks by developing (i) a standardized procedure for generating weighted small-world networks, (ii) a weighted extension of the SWP, and (iii) a stringent and generalizable method for mapping real-world data onto the theoretical model. In applying these techniques to real world brain networks, we uncover the surprising fact that the canonical example of a biological small-world network, the C. elegans neuronal network, has strikingly low SWP in comparison to other examined brain networks. These metrics, models, and maps form a coherent toolbox for the assessment of architectural properties in real-world networks and their statistical comparison across conditions.},
